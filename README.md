<h1>ChatGPT Clone - nexusInt</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is an academic endeavor to create a simplified version of ChatGPT, a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. The goal is to understand the principles behind natural language processing and machine learning models by building a basic chatbot system using Flask.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Text Generation: </b>The chatbot can generate text responses based on user input.</li>
    <li><b>Basic UI: </b>Includes a simple user interface for interacting with the chatbot.</li>
    <li><b>Server-Client Architecture: </b>Utilizes a client-server architecture for communication between the user interface and the backend server.</li>
    <li><b>OpenAI API Integration: </b>Optionally integrates with the OpenAI API for more advanced text generation capabilities.</li>
</ul>
